	 * 720-850- If you credit scores fall into this category your credit is
	 * considered perfect and you have nothing to worry about. You will also be
	 * eligible for the absolute lowest rates and any special financing that you
	 * would be interested in getting.
	 * 
	 * 680-719- While your credit is still considered good if it in this range
	 * your scores are only considered good. You will still get great rates but
	 * they will be slightly higher then if you scores were in the next range
	 * up.
	 * 
	 * 620-679- Generally in this range you will be able to get approved for
	 * most loans. Mortgages could be a problem is you are the lower end of this
	 * spectrum and if you are in this group you may want to look into cleaning
	 * up your credit report.
	 * 
	 * 580-619- This is really as low as you want to go in todays economy. Even
	 * with scores in this range you will have a hard time getting loans and you
	 * can kiss low rates good bye as they will be very high. You should invest
	 * in credit repair if you are in this range.
	 * 
	 * 350-579- You are in desperate need of help and a full blown credit repair
	 * process should be one of your top priorities. Financing will be next to
	 * impossible, in fact you may not even be able to get a cell phone with
	 * these types of scores!
